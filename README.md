This repository cotains the following files:
- run_analysis.R
- codebook.md
- README.md

The purpose of the run_analysis.R is to achieve the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Soure of Data: 10299 data points provided as part of the study[1],
